## Modeling Healthcare Worker Behaviors From Locator Traces 

__Abstract__

Every year approximately two million people in America are affected by healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), with nearly 75,000 of those infections resulting in death. The treatment of HAIs adds nearly $500 million to US healthcare costs per year. Despite good hand hygiene being the most effective preventive measure, compliance among HCWs still remains low. While there are possible alternative interventions to reduce HAIs—e.g. alternative patient room assignment strategies, changes to hospital infrastructure, vaccination mandates, increased personal protective equipment—implementing them is disruptive and expensive. Therefor our research instead aims to provide a simulation environment that will allow researchers to compare the effectiveness of such interventions in simulation before implementation in the clinical setting.
