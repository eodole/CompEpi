See cs1210 f15 project 2 although not that relevant.

Assumptions: rooms are always full. patients discharged only between
sessions. exclude schedules that have excessive housekeeper events as
these indicate a likely patient change mid-shift.

Order input records by itime.
R = {} # where R={rid:{hid:otime, hid:otime},...}

Process each day.
  process each visit.
    place {hid:otime} in R[rid], removing any other hid with otime < itime
    if hid is infected, attempt to infect pid and remaining hid in room based on overlap(s)
    if hid is uninfected, attempt to infect hid from pid and remaining hid by overlap(s)
  update status of all infected agents
  discharge/admit patients

To use script:

Edit query.sql to select a date to simulate from swipesense data.

mysql -p -u uihc ssense < query.sql | sed -e's/\t/,/g' | sed -e's|/|-|g' > input.csv
pysim.py < input.csv > output
